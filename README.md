# Ride Share Data Analysis (Uber)

The Ride Share Data Analysis project aims to provide insights and patterns from a dataset of ride-sharing service. The dataset contains 100,000 records of rides taken by users over a 2 months period in New York metroplolitan. 



## Dataset 
The dataset contains yellow and green taxi trip records with pick-up/drop-off details, fares, rate types, and more. For-hire vehicle trip records include dispatching base license numbers, pick-up dates, times, and location IDs. The data was collected and provided to NYC TLC by authorized technology providers, but TLC doesn't guarantee its accuracy. TLC publishes base trip data as submitted by bases, performing routine reviews for accuracy. The dataset offers valuable insights into taxi and for-hire vehicle usage in NYC, although completeness and accuracy cannot be fully guaranteed due to data sources.

## Objective
The objective of analyzing this dataset is to gain valuable insights and patterns related to taxi and for-hire vehicle usage in New York City. By exploring pick-up/drop-off times, locations, fares, rate types, and other details, the analysis aims to identify trends in demand and supply, user behavior, driver performance, and pricing strategies. Additionally, the analysis will assess customer satisfaction through user feedback and ratings. However, it should be noted that the dataset's accuracy and completeness cannot be fully guaranteed, but the analysis will provide valuable information for improving the overall ride-sharing service and making data-driven decisions.
